Question 2
a.  foo would first set the x value to u which is 42 essentially while the V value stays the same at 69 as it is statically bound
we then go into bar function which makes it so that value we use for x in the add function is linked to v which is 69 then using the add function
we get the answer to be 69 + 43 +69 which is equal to 180 which is what the function will print
180 is printed
b. With dynamic deep binding we initialize v as equal to 42 from u then from there we move to the bar add function in which we make w equal to 17
with v carrying over the same variable as the one initialized in the beginning however since we changed the value of V in the foo fucntion when we 
do the add we get  u:= u + u + u where u is equal to 42 resulting in our answer being 126 because foos v was turned into U/42 initially
126 is printed
c.with dynamic scope binding we first initialize v as 42 we then set u to 17 in the bar fucntion we then initialize the add function in which z is equal to local foo v which 
is 42 at this point and we get that U:= 42 + 17 + 42 which gives us the result of 101
101 is printed
